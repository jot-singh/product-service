# E-commerce Sample Backend Project

This README provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and running the E-commerce sample backend project developed in Java using REST APIs and the Spring Framework. This project is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of building an e-commerce backend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: The project requires a compatible version of the Java Development Kit to compile and run.

- **Apache Maven**: Maven is used for managing project dependencies and building the application. Make sure you have it installed.

- **Visual Studio Code**: We recommend using Visual Studio Code as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this project.

### Visual Studio Code Extensions

For a smoother development experience, you should install the following Visual Studio Code extensions:

- [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack): Provides essential Java development tools for VS Code.

- [Git](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode.git): Git integration to manage version control.

- [IntelliJ IDEA Keybindings (Optional)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=k--kato.intellij-idea-keybindings): Optional keybindings for IntelliJ IDEA users.

- [Spring Boot Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-spring-boot): Simplifies working with Spring Boot projects.

## Project Overview

This E-commerce sample backend project is built using the Spring Framework and Spring Boot, making it a robust and scalable solution for e-commerce applications. The key features and components of the project include:

- **Spring Boot**: The project utilizes Spring Boot for rapid application development, simplifying configuration and setup.

- **REST APIs**: RESTful web services are implemented to support essential e-commerce operations, including product management, order processing, and user authentication.

- **Maven Build**: Maven is used for project dependency management and build automation, ensuring a smooth development workflow.

- **Visual Studio Code**: We recommend using Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE for this project, along with the specified extensions.

- **References**: We encourage you to explore the official [Spring.io](https://spring.io/) website for extensive Spring Framework documentation. Additionally, you can use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to quickly generate Spring Boot projects with various dependencies.

Feel free to explore the project's source code in the `src/main/java` directory, where you'll find the main application class, controllers, services, and models.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the E-commerce sample backend project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jot-singh/product-service.git
   ```

## Project Setup

To set up and run the E-commerce sample backend project, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**: Open Visual Studio Code and select the project's root directory using the "Open Folder" option.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Visual Studio Code may prompt you to install Java and Maven extensions. Follow the prompts for installation. Ensure that you have all the recommended extensions installed.

3. **Edit Configuration (Optional)**: Customize project-specific configurations by editing the `application.properties` or `application.yml` files located in the `src/main/resources` directory.

4. **Build and Run the Project**:
   - Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code.
   - Run the following command to build and start the Spring Boot application:

     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

   - The application will start on the default port (usually 8080). Access the API documentation and test the endpoints by visiting `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.
